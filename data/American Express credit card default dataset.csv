The dataset is the property of American Express and is exclusively shared for educational purposes. The dataset consists of 45,528 rows and 19 columns. Notably, all features lack both group structure and time structure, rendering them independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) data. Among the 19 features, seven contain null values. It is noteworthy that 4.43% of data points have missing values.
